# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities privately. Use GitHub's private
vulnerability reporting for this repository: open the repository's **Security**
tab and select **Report a vulnerability**. This creates a private discussion
with the maintainers. Do not disclose vulnerability details in public issues,
pull requests, discussions, or other public channels.

If private vulnerability reporting is unavailable, contact the repository
maintainers through GitHub and ask for a private reporting channel. Share only
the minimum information needed to establish contact until a private channel is
available.

Include a description of the issue, affected component and versions or commit,
steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any suggested mitigation. Please
avoid accessing or modifying other users' data, disrupting services, or using
real funds; use local environments and test networks.

## Scope

This policy covers security vulnerabilities in this repository's code and
configuration, including:

- Stellar/Soroban smart contracts in `contracts/`
- Backend services and APIs in `backend/`
- Web and mobile applications in `frontend/` and `mobile/`
- Repository-owned infrastructure, deployment configuration, and CI workflows

Third-party services and infrastructure are out of scope unless the issue is
caused by this repository's integration or configuration. Findings that do not
create a security risk, and social-engineering attacks against users, are also
out of scope.

## Response Times

We aim to:

- Acknowledge a report within **3 business days**.
- Complete initial triage and provide an assessment within **7 business days**.
- Provide an update at least every **14 calendar days** while the report is
  being investigated or remediated.

These are response targets, not a guarantee of a fix by a particular date.
Complex issues may take longer; we will explain delays and keep the reporter
updated. Please coordinate public disclosure with the maintainers and allow
time for investigation and remediation.

## Supported Versions

The latest version on the default branch is supported for security reports.
Reports affecting released versions are welcome; include the affected version
or commit so maintainers can assess impact.
