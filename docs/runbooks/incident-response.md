# Incident Response Runbook

Severity levels, response steps, and escalation for production incidents.
Uses the same P0-P3 severity convention as
[threat-model.md](../threat-model.md).

## Severity levels

| Severity | Definition | Examples | Response time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0 - Critical** | Funds at risk, or the service is down for all users | Treasury/escrow contract draining unexpectedly; backend fully down; database unreachable in production; admin key compromise (see [threat-model.md](../threat-model.md) TH-P-02) | Immediate - page on-call now |
| **P1 - High** | Core functionality broken for a significant subset of users, no direct fund loss yet | Trade creation/deposit/release failing; auth broken for a subset of wallets; a migration failed mid-way in production | Immediate - page on-call |
| **P2 - Medium** | Degraded but workable; a non-core path is broken | Evidence upload failing; audit history export broken; elevated but not failing error rates; a feature-flagged feature misbehaving (can be disabled via [admin.md](../api/admin.md#feature-flags) as immediate mitigation) | Same business day |
| **P3 - Low** | Cosmetic or edge-case issue, no user-facing outage | Docs endpoint drift; a rarely-hit validation message is wrong | Next working session |

When in doubt, classify one level higher and downgrade after triage - it's
cheaper to stand down a P0 than to escalate a mishandled P1.

## Incident roles

For a P0/P1, name these roles explicitly at acknowledgement time (one
person can hold more than one role on a small team, but say so out loud so
everyone knows who is doing what):

| Role | Responsibility | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Incident Commander (IC)** | Owns the incident end to end: classifies severity, decides on mitigation vs. further diagnosis, calls the stand-down, and assigns the other roles. Does not necessarily write the fix themselves. | Whoever acknowledges first is IC by default until they explicitly hand it off |
| **Comms** | Posts and updates the status communication (see cadence below), keeps the timeline, and is the single point of contact for "what's the status" questions so the IC and Ops aren't interrupted mid-mitigation | On a one-or-two-person response, the IC also holds this role — but still write the updates |
| **Ops / Mitigator** | Executes the actual mitigation and diagnosis steps (rollback, feature-flag flip, key rotation, query the DB) under the IC's direction | Multiple people can hold this role in parallel on a larger incident |

## Incident channel & ticket conventions

- **Channel:** open (or reuse) `#incident-<yyyy-mm-dd>-<short-slug>` for
  anything P0/P1 (e.g. `#incident-2026-08-29-trade-release-500s`). Keep P2/P3
  coordination in the normal team channel unless it drags on.
- **Tracking issue:** open a GitHub issue labeled `incident` in this repo as
  soon as severity is classified, titled the same as the channel slug. This
  is the canonical timeline anchor and is where the postmortem (see below)
  gets linked once written.
- **Naming:** keep the slug short and specific to the symptom, not the
  suspected cause (`trade-release-500s`, not `contract-bug`) — causes change
  as investigation proceeds, symptoms don't.

## Immediate response steps

1. **Acknowledge.** Whoever notices first (alert, user report, or manual
   observation) claims the incident and starts a timeline (timestamped
   notes - what you observed, what you tried, what happened).
2. **Classify severity** using the table above.
3. **Mitigate before diagnosing**, if a fast mitigation exists:
   - Disable the specific feature flag if the incident traces to a
     flagged feature ([admin.md](../api/admin.md#feature-flags)) - this
     takes effect immediately with no redeploy.
   - Roll back the last deploy if the incident started right after one
     (see [rollback.md](./rollback.md)).
   - For a suspected fund-draining or key-compromise incident (P0), the
     priority is stopping further loss, not preserving evidence -
     revoke/rotate the admin key(s) in `ADMIN_STELLAR_PUBKEYS` and pause
     the affected flow if possible before anything else.
4. **Check health/status signals**:
   ```bash
   curl https://<host>/health/ready
   curl https://<host>/health/detail   # deeper dependency checks
   ```
   (see [trades.md](../api/trades.md) / [overview.md](../api/overview.md)
   for general API conventions, and [errors.md](../api/errors.md) for
   reading error codes out of application logs).
5. **Communicate.** Post an initial status update as soon as severity is
   classified, even before root cause is known - "investigating a P1
   affecting trade releases" beats silence. Update at a cadence
   proportional to severity (continuous for P0, every 30-60 min for P1).
   For messages to pilot users (SMS, WhatsApp, email), start from the
   [incident communication templates](./incident-communication-templates.md):
   outage, degraded service, funds-safe reassurance, and resolved.
6. **Escalate** per the table below if you can't mitigate or diagnose
   within the response-time target for the severity.

## Escalation matrix

| Situation | Escalate to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| P0/P1, on-call hasn't acknowledged within 10 min | Secondary on-call / eng lead | Don't wait past the response-time target to escalate |
| Suspected fund loss or admin-key compromise | Eng lead + whoever holds treasury/admin key rotation authority | Follow the mitigation-before-diagnosis order above |
| Failed production migration | On-call, immediately - see the escalation table in [migration-rollback-playbook.md](../migration-rollback-playbook.md#8-contacts-and-escalation) | Do not attempt further migrations until resolved |
| Data loss suspected | On-call immediately; stop all writes | Same as the migration playbook's guidance - do not run further migrations or write operations until the extent of loss is understood |
| Contract bug already executed on-chain (funds moved incorrectly) | Eng lead + treasury/admin key holder | This is not a rollback - see [rollback.md](./rollback.md#contract-rollback) |

## During the incident

- Keep the timeline updated - every mitigation attempt and its result, not
  just the final fix. This becomes the postmortem's evidence.
- Prefer the smallest change that stops user impact over a complete fix
  under pressure. Land the full fix as a follow-up once the incident is
  stood down.
- If a rollback is the mitigation, follow [rollback.md](./rollback.md)
  rather than improvising - rolling back application code while a
  migration is half-applied, or rolling back a contract upgrade with
  in-flight trades, has specific failure modes documented there.

## Stand-down criteria

An incident is resolved (not just mitigated) when:

- The user-facing symptom is gone and has stayed gone through at least one
  full traffic cycle.
- Root cause is identified (not just "the rollback fixed it").
- Any data inconsistency introduced during the incident has been
  accounted for (reconciled, or confirmed none exists).

## Postmortem

For P0/P1 incidents, write a blameless postmortem within 2 business days
using the [postmortem template](./postmortem-template.md), covering:
timeline, root cause, what mitigated it, what will prevent recurrence (with
owners and rough timing - not necessarily a hard deadline). Link the
postmortem from the incident's tracking issue, and publish the finished
document under [`docs/postmortems/`](../postmortems/README.md) - see that
directory's README for the archive/read-reminder process. P2/P3 incidents
get a postmortem at the reporter's discretion - always write one if the same
class of issue has recurred.

For a dry run of this whole process end to end - roles, channel/ticket
conventions, mitigation, and a completed postmortem - see the worked
[escrow-drain tabletop exercise](./tabletop-exercise-escrow-drain.md).
